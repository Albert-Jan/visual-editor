Visual Editor is a Rich Text editor for [Flutter] originally forked from [Flutter Quill]. The editor is built around the powerful [Quilljs Delta] document format originally developed by QuillJs. Delta documents can be easily converted to JSON, the encoding is easy to read and modify and offers many extensibility options.

**Why fork Flutter Quill?**

While building the [Visual Space] platform we begun using [Flutter Quill] to render text content for next generation interactive tutorials and projects. However, we had to deal with issues such as severe lack of documentation and testing plus a lack of technical support from the maintainers. Therefore, we decided to fork Quill and improve it with additional features and higher quality standards. Soon we will be publishing the entire Visual Kit, a set of widgets built for productivity apps.

## How To Start

**Minimal example**

Make sure you don't overwrite the controller on `build()` or other updates, otherwise you will lose the contents of the history. Which means no more undo, redo with the previous states.
```dart
final _controller = EditorController.basic();
```

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    EditorToolbar.basic(
      controller: _controller,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        child: VisualEditor.basic(
          controller: _controller,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

**Saving a document**
```dart
final json = jsonEncode(_controller.document.toDelta().toJson());
```

**Retrieving a document**
```dart
const blogPost = jsonDecode(response);

final _controller = EditorController(
  document: DocumentM.fromJson(blogPost),
  selection: TextSelection.collapsed(offset: 0)
);
```

**Delta or plain text**

Visual Editor uses [Delta] objects as an internal data format to describe the attributes of each fragment of text.

```dart
_controller.document.toDelta(); // Extract the deltas
_controller.document.toPlainText(); // Extract plain text
```
